Welcome to my porfolio website repo! I was a comp sci student that had great interest and passion creating applications.
I still have the same passion but due to a family tragedy, I had to look for a job that I could easily be hired quickly to help support my family.
It's been 2 years and I'm ready to get back into the fray!

Following my portfolio website and its contents were projects that I did in my spare time studying and some self taught initiatives such as Three.js and Blender.
Hoping to better improve on its user experience and my projects to add in as quality contents not only for future job aspects but for myself to serve as a milestone tacker.
